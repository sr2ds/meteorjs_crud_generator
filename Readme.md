Make no mistake, this is no big deal.

Made in PHP (for now), these simple codes will be able to make a simple complete scaffold for your meteorJs.

Currently it only generates the Collection with Schema from a JSON file.

To run, clone this repository into your meteor project and enter the directory.

When running ./meteor_crud Books.js, the script will create a collection within your meteor with the parameters passed in Books.js.

Soon I will leave new examples, as well as the continuation of the project.

TODO:
-> Create Collection;
-> Create Views;
-> Create Routes;
-> CRUD Complete;
-> Include module in Menu automatically.
